        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="css">
        <i class="fa-brands fa-css3-alt fa-2xl" style="color: #005eff;"></i>
        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style and layout web pages. It controls the appearance of HTML elements, including things like color, fonts, spacing, and positioning. Essentially, CSS dictates how the content of a web page looks and feels. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="js">
        <i class="fa-brands fa-js fa-2xl" style="color: #FFD43B;"></i>
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="bootstrap">
        <i class="fa-brands fa-bootstrap fa-2xl" style="color: #6e3dff;"></i>
        <h3>BootStrap</h3>
        <p>Bootstrap (formerly Twitter Bootstrap) is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. As of May 2023, Bootstrap is the 17th most starred project (4th most starred library) on GitHub, with over 164,000 stars.[4] According to W3Techs, Bootstrap is used by 19.2% of all websites.</p>

        <div id="python">
            <i class="fa-brands fa-python fa-2xl" style="color: #ffc800;"></i>
            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="js-1">
            <i class="fa-brands fa-js fa-2xl" style="color: #FFD43B;"></i>
            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>The first engines for JavaScript were mere interpreters of the source code, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance.[56] JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has one. In a browser, the JavaScript engine runs in concert with the rendering engine via the Document Object Model and Web IDL bindings.[57] However, the use of JavaScript engines is not limited to browsers; for example, the V8 engine is a core component of the Node.js runtime system.[58] Since ECMAScript is the standardized specification of JavaScript, ECMAScript engine is another name for these implementations. With the advent of WebAssembly, some engines can also execute this code in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.</p>

            <h1>Frameworks</h1>
            <div id="django">
                <h3>Django</h3>
                <p>Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself.[8] Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.</p>

            <div id="nodejs">
                <i class="fa-brands fa-node fa-2xl" style="color: #000000;"></i>
                <h3>Nodejs</h3>
                <p>Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.</p>

            <div id="spring">
                <i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-leaf fa-2xl" style="--fa-primary-color: #118f00; --fa-secondary-color: #88da41;"></i>                <h3>Spring</h3>
                <p>The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform.[2] The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform. The framework does not impose any specific programming model.[citation needed]. The framework has become popular in the Java community as an addition to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model.[3] The Spring Framework is free and open source software.</p>

            <h3>SQL</h3>
            <p>Structured Query Language (SQL) (pronounced /ˌɛsˌkjuˈɛl/ S-Q-L; or alternatively as /ˈsiːkwəl/ ⓘ "sequel") [4][5] is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.
                Introduced in the 1970s, SQL offered two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, i.e., with or without an index.
                Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements,[6] which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: Data query Language (DQL), Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Control Language (DCL), and Data Manipulation Language (DML).[7]
                The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update, and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.
                SQL was one of the first commercial languages to use Edgar F. Codd's relational model. The model was described in his influential 1970 paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks".[8] Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, SQL became the most widely used database language.[9][10]
                SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.[11] Since then, the standard has been revised multiple times to include a larger set of features and incorporate common extensions. Despite the existence of standards, virtually no implementations in existence adhere to it fully, and most SQL code requires at least some changes before being ported to different database systems.</p>

            <h3>MongoDB</h3>
            <p>MongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database product, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. Released in February 2009 by 10gen (now MongoDB Inc.), it supports features like sharding, replication, and ACID transactions (from version 4.0). MongoDB Atlas, its managed cloud service, operates on AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. Current versions are licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL). MongoDB is a member of the MACH Alliance.</p>
